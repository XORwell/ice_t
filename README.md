IceT is a ruby library for handling repeated events.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ice_t'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ice_t

## Usage

### Creating rules

```ruby
rule = IceT::Rule::Secondly.new(42)  # => every 42 seconds
rule = IceT::Rule::Minutely.new(42)  # => every 42 minutes
rule = IceT::Rule::Hourly.new(42)    # => every 42 hours
rule = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(42)     # => every 42 days
rule = IceT::Rule::Weekly.new(42)    # => every 42 weeks
rule = IceT::Rule::Monthly.new(42)   # => every 42 months
rule = IceT::Rule::Yearly.new(42)    # => every 42 years
```

```ruby
rule = IceT::Rule::Secondly.new      # => every second
```


### Get time occurrences

```ruby
rule.occurrences # => Array of times
```

### Schedule

The Schedule helps on dealing with multiple rules.

```ruby
schedule = IceT::Schedule.new(start_time: Time.now, end_time: Time.now + 4.months)
schedule.add_rule my_daily_rule
schedule.add_rule my_monthly_rule

schedule.rules              # => Array of rules
schedule.occurrences        # => Merged occurrences
```

### Persistence

Lets say you want to store and restore your Schedule. Do this:

```ruby
json = schedule.to_json
schedule = IceT::Schedule.from_json(json)
```

## Tipps - section is under construction

### Sorting rules:

[r2,r1,r3].sort.collect(&:interval) 

### Comparing rules:
	
```ruby
IceT::Rule::Daily.new(1) < IceT::Rule::Monthly.new(1) # => true
```

```ruby
r2.between?(r1, r3)
```
IceT::Rule::Daily.new(14).occurrences(1.year.ago, Time.now).first(5)

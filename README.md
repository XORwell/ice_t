IceT is a ruby library for handling repeated events.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ice_t'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ice_t

## Usage

### Creating rules

```ruby
rule = IceT::Rule::Secondly.new(42)  # => every 42 seconds
rule = IceT::Rule::Minutely.new(42)  # => every 42 minutes
rule = IceT::Rule::Hourly.new(42)    # => every 42 hours
rule = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(42)     # => every 42 days
rule = IceT::Rule::Weekly.new(42)    # => every 42 weeks
rule = IceT::Rule::Monthly.new(42)   # => every 42 months
rule = IceT::Rule::Yearly.new(42)    # => every 42 years
```

```ruby
rule = IceT::Rule::Secondly.new      # => every second
```


### Get time occurrences

```ruby
rule.occurrences(2.days.ago, Time.now) # => Array of times

IceT::Rule::Daily.new(14).occurrences(1.year.ago, Time.now).first(5)

```

### Persistence

Store and restore the rule:

```ruby

# JSON
rule = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(42)
json = rule.to_json
restored = IceT::Rule::Base.from_json(json)

# YAML
rule = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(42)
yaml = rule.to_yaml
restored = IceT::Rule::Base.from_yaml(yaml)

# Hash
rule = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(42)
hash = rule.to_hash
restored = IceT::Rule::Base.from_hash(hash)

```


### Comparison and sorting
	
```ruby
IceT::Rule::Daily.new(1) < IceT::Rule::Monthly.new(1) # => true
```

```ruby
# compare different type of rules

minutely = IceT::Rule::Minutely.new(1)
hourly   = IceT::Rule::Hourly.new(1)
daily    = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(1)

hourly.between?(minutely, daily) # => true
minutely.between?(hourly, daily) # => false


# compare same type of rules

r1 = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(1)
r2 = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(2)
r3 = IceT::Rule::Daily.new(3)

r2.between?(r1, r2)	# => true
r1.between?(r2, r3)	# => false

# sort these rules

[r2,r1,r3].sort.collect(&:interval) # => [1, 2, 3]

```
